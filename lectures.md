# Lectures

All lectures are distributed via pre-recorded videos available each week on the course website. Each week's lecture will be made available at the beginning of the week. Watching the videos closely (while preferably taking notes) is essential in being able to succeed in the assignments, flash quizzes, and the exams in this course. Each week's lectures will have assigned readings from the required textbook.
