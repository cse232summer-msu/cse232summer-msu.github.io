## Content

All exams will contain both multiple-choice questions, and short-answer questions. Some sample MCQs from Spring 2024 are provided to you on their respective [lecture](../lectures/) pages. Short Q&As will mostly involve coding problems, where you may either be asked to solve a small coding problem, or generate outputs for a given code on certain inputs.

All exams are comprehensive, and include material from lectures, assignments, quizzes, and the textbook. Each exam will cover material up to and including the week prior. For instance, Exam 1 will cover Week 01 and Week 02.

## Cheatsheets and Exam Aids

All exams are open note. Which means, you are permitted to use any non-electronic material you wish. Generally, students tend to bring printouts of reference material, textbooks, notes, sample questions, etc. You may find it useful to split your material into two; general material, and material on topics you tend to struggle with.

<!-- For the Final Exam, you might consider the useful functions in the STL algorithm library and the many data structures (`std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::map`, `std::set`, etc.). -->

<!-- ### Required Textbook

Exam questions will refer directly to examples and statements from the required textbook, "Tour of C++, 3rd Ed.". Please ensure that you bring a physical copy of the book to all exams.

## Preparation

Associated with each week, sample exam questions are provided with questions broadly similar to the ones that will appear on the actual exam. The best way to prepare is to solve these sample exams, on your own, with the material you intend to bring to the actual exam. If you can't solve a question, come to help room, or ask on Piazza. We recommend that only after solving the sample questions, should you look at the solutions.


## Multiple Choice Exam Details

The exam location and time(s) will be announced on Piazza. The exams are conducted with bubble sheets, so be sure to bring a pencil and eraser. No electronics are allowed, so please leave smart watches, headphones, and similar wearables in your bag. The time remaining will be announced verbally and written on the board.

## Coding Exam Details

Two of the lab sessions will be dedicated to lab practicals. You will be given an in-class Codio assignment in lieu of the regular lab assignment. Please bring your computer (recommended fully charged as there are limited outlets) to the lab you are enrolled in. The exam's Codio page is the only application that you're allowed to have open (no IDEs). You are welcome to use any non-electronic resource during the exam. This includes textbooks, printed lecture slides, notes, example solutions to homework (including instructor solutions), and birthday cards. You may **not** use any online reference material or any other electronic resource. -->

## Makeup Exams

As this is an accelerated course, it will not be possible for us to provide any makeup exams. If you miss an exam due to documented illness or emergency, please send me an email with detailing the circumstances around why you did not attend the scheduled exam, along with all relevant offical documents. If your reasons are acceptable, it may be possible to schedule a one-on-one oram exam over Zoom, where your mastery of the material will be tested.

## Accommodation

If you have an accommodations letter from RCPD, and have not shared it with me yet, please do immediately so that you can be properly accommodated. If you have already sent me your accommodation letter, you will be given specific instructions based on your accommodation needs before each exam.
