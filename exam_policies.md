## Content

All exams will be on D2L using lockdown browser, and will contain both multiple-choice questions, and short-answer questions. Some sample MCQs from Spring 2024 are provided to you on their respective [lecture](../lectures/) pages. Short Q&As will mostly involve coding problems, where you may either be asked to solve a small coding problem, or generate outputs for a given code on certain inputs.

All exams are comprehensive, and include material from lectures, assignments, quizzes, and the textbook. Each exam will cover material up to and including the week prior. For instance, Exam 1 will cover Week 01 and Week 02.

## Cheatsheets and Exam Aids

All exams are open note. Which means, you are permitted to use any non-electronic material you wish. Generally, students tend to bring printouts of reference material, textbooks, notes, sample questions, etc. You may find it useful to split your material into two; general material, and material on topics you tend to struggle with.

<!-- For the Final Exam, you might consider the useful functions in the STL algorithm library and the many data structures (`std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::map`, `std::set`, etc.). -->

## Makeup Exams

As this is an accelerated course, it will not be possible for us to provide any makeup exams. If you miss the final exam due to documented illness or emergency, please send me an email detailing the circumstances around why you did not attend the scheduled exam, along with all relevant official documents. If your reasons are acceptable, it may be possible to schedule a one-on-one oral exam over Zoom, where your mastery of the material will be tested.

### Before Exam

- Be sure you have the following items ready:
	- A desktop or a fully charged (or plugged in) laptop computer capable of running Zoom and screen sharing with a functional microphone and a webcam.
	- A fully charged (or plugged in) smartphone or a tablet capable of running Zoom with a functional camera that can show your workspace during exams.
	- Access to a stable internet connection from both devices mentioned above.
	- Your non-electronic notes.
	- Your MSU student ID card (or some other valid identification card if you are not an MSU student).
- Be sure to use the restroom before the exam, if you need to.
- Join Zoom using your smartphone or tablet at least 15 minutes early. If you arrive late, you will not be given any additional time.
- Be sure your microphone is muted, and your video is turned on. Position your smartphone or tablet in a way so that your face, your desk, and your screen are clearly visible. See the above image for reference. A good idea is to have this setup ready and tested (in your own personal Zoom room) beforehand.
- After joining Zoom, you will be moved into a breakout room, where a course staff will check your MSU student ID card. **You will not be allowed to take the exam without a valid ID card.**
- At 6:00pm (EST), a course staff will broadcast a passkey, using which you will be able to access the exam on D2L.

### During Exam

- Keep the speaker volume of your smartphone or tablet turned up (but the microphone muted) during the exam. You need to be able to hear the course staff if they call on you, or make a general announcement.
- Under no circumstances should you leave your desk during the exam. If you feel there is a valid reason for which you are compelled to leave your desk, you must first draw the attention of the course staff assigned to your breakout room (without turning on your microphone). You if you leave without informing a course staff, your exam may be forfeited, and you will receive a zero.
- Under no circumstances should your video feed be turned off. Low battery is not an acceptable excuse. If your video is turned off, and you do not respond to a course staff when called on, your exam may be forfeited, and you will receive a zero.
- The course staff holds the right to suspend your exam, if you are suspected of cheating.

### After Exam

- If you finish your exam early, please do not leave or turn your camera off. You must wait until 8:00pm (EST) before leaving.

<!-- ### Required Textbook

Exam questions will refer directly to examples and statements from the required textbook, "Tour of C++, 3rd Ed.". Please ensure that you bring a physical copy of the book to all exams.

## Preparation

Associated with each week, sample exam questions are provided with questions broadly similar to the ones that will appear on the actual exam. The best way to prepare is to solve these sample exams, on your own, with the material you intend to bring to the actual exam. If you can't solve a question, come to help room, or ask on Piazza. We recommend that only after solving the sample questions, should you look at the solutions.


## Multiple Choice Exam Details

The exam location and time(s) will be announced on Piazza. The exams are conducted with bubble sheets, so be sure to bring a pencil and eraser. No electronics are allowed, so please leave smart watches, headphones, and similar wearables in your bag. The time remaining will be announced verbally and written on the board.

## Coding Exam Details

Two of the lab sessions will be dedicated to lab practicals. You will be given an in-class Codio assignment in lieu of the regular lab assignment. Please bring your computer (recommended fully charged as there are limited outlets) to the lab you are enrolled in. The exam's Codio page is the only application that you're allowed to have open (no IDEs). You are welcome to use any non-electronic resource during the exam. This includes textbooks, printed lecture slides, notes, example solutions to homework (including instructor solutions), and birthday cards. You may **not** use any online reference material or any other electronic resource. -->



## Accommodation

If you have an accommodation letter from RCPD, and have not shared it with me yet, please do so immediately, so that you can be properly accommodated. If you have already sent me your accommodation letter, you will be given specific instructions based on your accommodation needs before each exam.
