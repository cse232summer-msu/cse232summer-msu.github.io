## Course Schedule

There are two assignments and two flash quizzes every week. Assignments are due Mondays and Thursdays before 11:59pm. Flash quizzes are due Tuesdays and Fridays before 11:59.

Due dates are subject to change, but if a change is made, an announcement will be posted to Ed Discussion.

<!-- Below are links to the lectures for that week. All other material will be provided via D2L. -->

## Help Room Schedule

Help Room is conducted through Zoom. You can find the link to the meeting and the times on Ed Discussion. Help Room will begin the evening of 2024-01-09.

Please be aware that you may not receive the attention you desire if you attend help room very near an assignment deadline. So please consider attending help room prior to the day an assignment is due as there will be less demand. 

Please direct any and all written communication to Ed Discussion (you can post anonymously if that's something you'd prefer). Emails may not be responded to.

If you would like a one-on-one meeting with an instructor, please make a private Ed Discussion post detailing your request and availability.
