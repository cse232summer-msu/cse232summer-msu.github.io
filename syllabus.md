## General Information

### Course Description

In this course, you will learn how to use the C++ language effectively, to write readable, and efficient programs, learn how to use the abstractions in the language, as well as writing your own abstractions, learn about the static type system, and the C++ compilation model, learn how to use simple data structures, and write some of your own.

### Objectives

The focus of the course will be twofold:
- Learn the C++ language, with a focus on using the available functionality in the STL.
- Learn how these tools work, so you can design your own data structures and algorithms.

## Course Materials
<!-- - $40 Payment to Codio, details presented in first lab. -->
- Textbooks
    - [Tour of C++, 3rd Ed. by Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Tour+of+C%2B%2B%2C+3rd+Edition) (Required)
    - [C++ Primer, 5th Ed. by Lippman, Lajoie, Moo.](https://www.google.com/search?q=C%2B%2B+Primer%2C+5th+Edition) (Supplemental)
    <!-- - [Introduction to C++, 1st Ed. by George S. Tselikis](https://www.google.com/search?q=Introduction+to+C%2B%2B%2C+1st+Edition) (Supplemental) -->
- A desktop or laptop computer capable of running Zoom and screen-sharing.
- A phone or a tablet capable of running Zoom with a camera that can show your workspace while taking exams.
- A stable internet connection for streaming video through Zoom, and for watching lecture videos.

## Lectures

All lectures are distributed via pre-recorded videos available each week on the course website. Each week's lecture will be made available at the beginning of the week. Watching the videos closely (while preferably taking notes) is essential in being able to succeed in the assignments, flash quizzes, and the exams in this course. Each week's lectures will have assigned readings from the required textbook.

<!-- ## Laboratory Sessions

Lab section will be conducted in STEM 2201. Performing the work assigned in your laboratory section is *mandatory*.

The lab sessions are designed to be learning tools that complement the lectures, as well as collaborative experiences where students work with each other and the Teaching Assistants to complete the exercise. Students who are late to lab might not receive credit for that session. Attendance is based on a good faith effort, i.e., the TAs will decide if you have put in a sincere effort to participate actively, collaborate with others, and attempt to complete the exercise. Each lab tends to cover content up to and including the week prior. -->

## Communication

All forms of communication with the course staff should be done through Ed Discussion. All class announcements will be made through Ed Discussion. The course instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, scheduling, and assignment specifications, should the necessity arise.

### Assignments

There are two assignments every week. Assignments are due Mondays and Thursdays before 11:59pm, and will either cover content from everything up until and including the previous week (Monday assignments), or everything up until and including the running week (Thursday assignments).

<!-- A homework assignment will be due every Thursday at 10 PM. Each homework assignment is worth 10 points. There will be 14 graded assignments given. Homework assignments will cover content from the week they are due as well as material covered earlier in the course. At the due date, solutions will be released to aid students that have yet to complete the assignment. Homework assignments will be accepted up to two days after the original due date. -->

<!-- ## Honors Section

To earn honors credit for this course, you need to be enrolled in an Honors Lab Section. The honors lab sections and non-honors lab sections have the labs will cover different material. Instead of practicing on programming assignments covering recently taught material, they will teach new, advanced programming techniques in C++. 

Additionally, students enrolled in an honors lab section must earn at least 90 points on honors lab assignments to receive a passing grade. The in-lab coding exams for the honors lab sections will have content specific to material covered in the honors lab sections.

We encourage honors lab sections students to also complete the non-honors lab assignments for practice, but it isn't required, nor worth points. -->

### Flash Quizzes

There are two flash quizzes every week. A flash quiz is due one day after every assignment, and covers the same content as the assignment it is coupled with. Flash quizzes can be 5 to 10 minutes in duration, where you will have (on average) 15 seconds to answer each multiple-choice question.

### Exams

<!-- #### Multiple Choice Exams -->

There will be a three synchronous exams, named "Exam 1", "Exam 2", and "Final Exam". Exam 1 and Exam 2 are worth 20 points each. Final Exam is worth 30 points. Exam 1, Exam 2, and the Final Exam will be held on Week 3, Week 5, and Week 7, respectively. The exact dates and times will be announced on Ed Discussion at a later time.

<!-- #### Coding Exams

Additionally, there will be two lab practical coding exams ("Midterm Coding Exam" and "Final Coding Exam") which will take place in lab each worth 150 points.

### Labs

There are 11 graded labs throughout the semester, each lab is worth 10 points. There are two ways to earn these points:

#### Preferred Option:

If you attend your in-person lab section, come prepared (having watched the previous week's lectures), follow directions, and participate, you will be awarded full credit by your lab's TAs, regardless of the actual progress made on the lab assignment.

#### Alternative Option

You can alternatively complete the lab assignment by 10pm of Monday the following week and earn the points associated with that lab. -->

                <td>20%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Exam 2</td>

                <td>30%</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

Final grades for students who achieve the course minimum requirements are based on this scale:

<div align="center">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Points</th>
                <th>GPA</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody align="center">
            <tr>
                <td>90-100</td>
                <td>4.0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>85-89</td>
                <td>3.5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>80-84</td>
                <td>3.0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>75-79</td>
                <td>2.5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>70-74</td>
                <td>2.0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>65-69</td>
                <td>1.5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>60-64</td>
                <td>1.0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0-59</td>
                <td>0.0</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

Grades are rounded to the nearest integer. Therefore, a grade of 89.5 will round to 90 and result in a grade of 4.0. A grade of 89.45 will round down to 89 and result in a grade of 3.5.

## Extensions

Make-up exams may be arranged if your absence is caused by a documented illness or personal emergency. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be emailed to Dr. Momtaz. If the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. When possible, make-up arrangements should be completed in advance.

If you are unable to complete an assignment before the specified due date because of illness or a personal emergency, you should contact Dr. Momtaz as early as possible. If the explanation is acceptable, the assignment due date will be extended, and other necessary arrangements will be made.

## Academic Honesty

### Spartan Code of Honor

> As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor in ownership is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.

### Plagiarism

Plagiarism (unsourced use of other's intellectual property) is not allowed. However, citing and using others' works is generally fine (please ask if uncertain), as long as the material was not made specifically for solving the assignments in this class.

### Examples Of Academic Misconduct

One of the goals of this course is to teach professionalism. Any instance of academic dishonesty will be viewed as evidence that this goal has not been achieved, and will be grounds for receiving a final grade of 0.0. Examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited to):

- Using code implemented by someone else without attributing credit (i.e., you can use tools, libraries, or code snippets from the web, but only with proper citations).
- Violating exam policies (e.g. communicating or using AI during an exam).
- Writing code that deceptively passes the test cases, but doesn't solve the problem given. In other words, abusing automatic grader mechanisms to gain unearned points (hard coding).
- Distributing course content without the instructor's permission.
- Providing false information to the instructor about matters related to the course.
- Facilitating another student in any of the above activities.

### How To Provide Attribution

You must provide attribution if you make use of sources beyond the material given to you in this class. The attribution should be commented in your code and/or added to a README file included with your assignment. Please ask if you are uncertain as to if a source is allowed to be used in your assignment. 

Example solution with attribution:

```python
# The assignment is to read in a string that looks like "010 001 0101"
# and print out sum of the binary numbers with zero padding.

input_str = input()
bin_strs = input_str.split()


def convert_bin_str_to_int(bin_str):
    # Discovered int function from:
    # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8928240/convert-base-2-binary-number-string-to-int
    return int(bin_str, 2)


# In discussion with Grant King, we found that the map function
# would be useful in converting both numbers
ints = map(convert_bin_str_to_int, bin_strs)

# This Piazza post helped me determine how to print binary numbers with padding:
# https://piazza.com/class/lldas7863631i176d/post/7
print("{0:06b}".format(sum(ints)))
```

Exception, here are sources which don't require attribution (so that you don't have to cite every line of code): 

- Class-related materials (lectures, example code)
- Documentation from the linked reference websites (python.org, cppreference.com, cplusplus.com)
- Required or supplemental textbooks

Everything else, including conceptual discussions with other students should be attributed.

### Generative AI

The use of generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Bard) is permitted on assignments with attribution. However, we strongly recommend not becoming overly reliant on such tools, as they are not permitted on exams. Additionally, the assignments are given primarily to provide the opportunity to practice the application of the material taught, and merely asking AI to generate a solution without learning how to solve the problems yourself robs you of that practice.

<!-- So we recommend against the use of generative AI as a "solve me" button, but if you feel that it allows you to better learn the material, you are welcome to use it. -->

### Collaboration

There are no group assignments in this course. Your assignments should be your own work. Intellectual collaboration with other students in the class is allowed, but each student should write (and not share) their own code. The use of material or code from a student that previously took the course is an explicit instance of academic dishonesty. If a student submits code that they do not understand, such is also an act of academic dishonesty.

<!-- While it is encouraged to seek help if you are struggling with a specific problem in an assignment, it is still unacceptable to copy someone else's work, and claim it as your own. -->

__Under no circumstances should you share any part of an assignment solution with another student. Simply showing your solution to another student almost guarantees detection by the plagiarism software. Past experience shows that a student who asks to "look at" your solution will copy parts of it or pass it along to someone else who copies it.__

Each assignment submission is electronically (and manually, if need be) compared to all other solutions (in this course and previous offerings) to identify similarities between solutions.

<!-- On homework and especially labs, we strongly encourage you to collaborate on the assignments. Learning how to write code on your own is an important task, but equally important is learning how to read other's code and collaborate together. As such, we encourage the open discussion of homework and lab assignments on Piazza and more directly between your peers. You are welcome to share solutions, discuss potential implementations, and collectively debug each other's code. If you are inspired by other's work in your own solution (or if you just like how they solved a problem), please remember to cite your sources as described above.

Please note that just copying others work, without putting in the time to learn the assignments, will result in you not benefiting from the practice that the homework and labs provide. Although you could just copy all the homework solutions from your peers, you will not be learning how to write and read code yourself. -->

<!-- ## Extenuating Circumstances

The goal of this class is for you to learn. If you find that anything is coming in your way of that goal, please talk with the course instructor about it. We plan to keep the class flexible to the learning styles that seem to work best for the students, so feedback is always appreciated. In particular, due to the ongoing global pandemic, we understand that you might need additional support. Please don't hesitate in reaching out to us for anything that might affect your learning. -->

## Grief Absence Policy

If there are unfortunate circumstances that would lead you to have unexpected absences, MSU has a [Grief Absence Policy](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Notices/GriefAbsence.aspx). Please contact the Associate Dean, and we will make every effort to aid you in continuing the class after we receive confirmation from the administration.

## Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities

Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services, and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the [Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities](https://www.rcpd.msu.edu/) at 517-884-RCPD. Once your eligibility for accommodation has been determined, you will be issued an accommodation letter. Please email this form to Dr. Momtaz within the first two weeks of the semester.

## Religious Observances

Accommodation will be made for religious observances if requests are made well in advance. Since religious observances are usually known at the beginning of class and assignment due dates are in the schedule, we expect students to request accommodation at the beginning of the semester, but we require that accommodations be requested at least 2 weeks before the observance. See MSU's [Religious Observance Policy](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Notices/ReligiousPolicy.aspx) for more details.

## Acceptable Use Policy

All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system and laboratory classrooms provided for this course. Account usage guidelines published by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering are posted under the [CSE AUP](https://www.cse.msu.edu/Resources/Facilities/Policies/AUP.php).
